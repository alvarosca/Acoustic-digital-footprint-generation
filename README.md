# Acoustic digital footprint generation.

This repository contains the Matlab code and the academic report of the final project
of the course "Signal Processing" imparted in the faculty of engineering of UBA. 

The project is based on the paper "A Highly Robust Audio Fingerprinting System" Haitsma et al., 2002.

It consists on a Matlab code that allows to obtain a compressed version of an audio signal based on the relationship between the energy of contiguous frequency bands in the spectrogram of the signal.

This program was later used to perform recognition of a song within a small database using a short extract belonging to it (Code not included).
